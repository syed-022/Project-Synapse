Project Synapse: An AI-Based Intelligent System for Data-Driven Decision MakingProject Synapse is a full-stack web application designed to empower non-technical domain experts with the tools of modern machine learning. It transforms raw, tabular data into actionable, trustworthy, and explainable decisions through a seamless and interactive user experience.This platform bridges the gap between complex AI models and human intuition, moving beyond simple predictions to provide deep, understandable insights.Core FeaturesðŸ“ˆ Data-to-Decision Pipeline: Upload any structured CSV dataset and automatically train, benchmark, and select the best-performing machine learning model for your specific problem.ðŸ¤– Interactive "What-If" Simulator: Dynamically adjust input variables and receive real-time predictions, turning the model into an exploratory tool for decision-making.ðŸ’¡ Explainable AI (XAI) Core: Demystifies the "black box." Every prediction is accompanied by a clear visualization showing the exact factors that influenced the outcome, powered by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).ðŸ’¬ Conversational AI Assistant: A built-in chatbot that can explain technical concepts, clarify results, and provide suggestions for improving model performance, making the platform accessible to users of all skill levels.Tech Stack| Component | Technology || Frontend | React.js, Tailwind CSS || Backend | Python, FastAPI || ML/AI | Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP || Deployment | Docker, Render |How to Run & DeployThis project is structured as a monorepo with a separate frontend and backend, configured for easy deployment on Render.1. Create a GitHub Repository:Create a new repository on GitHub and upload all the files from this project into it.2. Deploy with Render:Connect your GitHub account to Render.com.Create a new Blueprint service, selecting your repository.Render will automatically detect and use the render.yaml file to build and deploy both the backend API and the frontend application.The first deployment may take a few minutes as the services are built and initialized.Once deployed, you will have a live, publicly accessible URL for your application.
